## v0.2-alpha

Half rewrite of the first version:
* patches are now embedded: less problems
* patching is done via if/elif, so if there's no newer patch assume the previous is good. Less problems
* now patching templates instead of *current* nginx files, so patches survives zimbra restart. Less problems
* now patching all nginx templates instead of just http/https: all cert requests goes straight to nginx. Less variations, less problems
* improved README documentation
