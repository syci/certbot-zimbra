# certbot-zimbra
Automated letsencrypt/certbot certificate deploy script for Zimbra hosts.

The script tweaks zimbra's nginx config to allow access of *.well-known* webserver location from local files instead of redirecting upstream to jsp. So it **may not be used if there's no *zimbra-nginx* package installed**.

Letsencrypt by default tries to verify a domain using https, so the script should work fine if [*zimbraReverseProxyMailMode*](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Enabling_Zimbra_Proxy_and_memcached#Protocol_Requirements_Including_HTTPS_Redirect)s is set to *both* or *https*. May not work for *http* only.

This is still a BETA script. Tested on:
* 8.8.8_UBUNTU16
* 8.7.11_RHEL7
* 8.6_RHEL7
* 8.6_UBUNTU12

# Requirements

* zimbra-proxy package is required
* either `certbot` or `letsencrypt` binary is required

## Certbot installation

The preferred way is to install it is by using the wizard [at certbot's home](https://certbot.eff.org/). Choose *None of the above* as software and your operating system. This will allow you to install easily upgradable system packages.

By installing Certbot via packages it automatically creates a cron schedule to renew certificates (at least on Ubuntu). 
We must **disable this schedule** because after the renew we must deploy it in Zimbra. 
So open `/etc/cron.d/certbot` with your favourite editor and **comment the last line**.

# Limitations

* The script doesn't handle multiple domains configured with SNI (see #8). You can still request a single certificate for multiple hostnames.

# Usage

```bash
USAGE: certbot_zimbra.sh < -n | -r | -p > [-d my.host.name] [-e extra.domain.tld] [-x] [-w /var/www]
```

## Command options

Either one of these action is mandatory:

* -n | --new: performs a request for a new certificate
* -r | --renew: deploys certificate, assuming it has just been renewed
* -p | --patch-only: does only nginx patching. Useful to be called before renew, in case nginx templates have been overwritten by an upgrade

Optional arguments:

* -d | --hostname: hostname being requested. If not passed uses `zmhostname`
* -e | --extra-domain: additional domains being requested. Can be used multiple times
* -x | --no-nginx: doesn't check and patch zimbra's nginx. Assumes some other webserver is listening on port 80
* -w | --webroot: if there's another webserver on port 80/443 specify its webroot
* -a | --agree-tos: agree with the Terms of Service of Let's Encrypt (avoids prompt)
* -c | --prompt-confirmation: ask for confirmation before proceding with cert request showing detected hostname
* -s | --services <service_names>: the set of services to be used for a certificate. Valid services are 'all' or any of: ldap,mailboxd,mta,proxy. Default: 'all'
* -z | --no-zimbra-restart: do not restart zimbra after a certificate deployment
* -u | --no-public-hostname-detection: do not detect additional hostnames from domains' zimbraServicePublicHostname. Enabled when -e is passed
* -j | --no-port-check: disable port 80 check

## Zimbra 8.6+ single server example

Run
`./certbot_zimbra.sh -n`
it should do everything by itself, including **restarting zimbra**. 

The domain of the certificate is obtained automatically by running `zmhostname`. If you want do request a specific hostname use the `-d/--hostname` option.

The certificate can be requested with additional hostnames. By default the script loops though all Zimbra domains, fetches 
the `zimbraPublicServiceHostname` attribute and adds the value to the request. If you want to disable this behavior use the `-u/--no-public-hostname-detection` option. 
To indicate additional domains explicitly use the `-e/--extra-domain` option (can be specified multiple times). Note that `-e` disables additional hostname detection. 

## Renewal

EFF suggest to run *renew* twice a day. Since this would imply restarting zimbra, once a day outside workhours should be fine. So in your favourite place (like `/etc/cron.d/zimbracrontab`) schedule the commands below, as suitable for your setup:

```
12 5 * * * root /usr/bin/certbot renew --pre-hook "/usr/local/bin/certbot_zimbra.sh -p" --renew-hook "/usr/local/bin/certbot_zimbra.sh -r "
```
The `--pre-hook` ensures Zimbra's nginx is patched to allow certificate verification. You can omit it if you remember to manually execute that command after an upgrade or
a reinstall which may restore nginx's templates to their default.

The `--renew-hook` parameter has been added since certbot 0.7.0, so check your version before using it. If it's not supported you should get a workaround, but probably the easiest way is to upgrade certbot.

The domain to renew is automatically obtained with `zmhostname`. If you need customized domain name pass the `-d` parameter after `-r`.

## Renewal using Systemd
The example below uses the renew-hook which will only rerun the script if a renewal was successfull and thus only reloading zimbra when needed.

Create a service file eg: /etc/systemd/system/renew-letsencrypt.service

```
[Unit]
Description=Renew Let's Encrypt certificates
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
# check for renewal, only start/stop nginx if certs need to be renewed
ExecStart=/usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet --agree-tos --pre-hook "/usr/local/bin/certbot_zimbra.sh -p" --renew-hook "/usr/local/bin/certbot_zimbra.sh -r"
```

Create a timer file to run the above once a day at 2am: /etc/systemd/system/renew-letsencrypt.timer

```
[Unit]
Description=Daily renewal of Let's Encrypt's certificates

[Timer]
# once a day, at 2AM
OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:00:00
# Be kind to the Let's Encrypt servers: add a random delay of 0–3600 seconds
RandomizedDelaySec=3600
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Then reload the unit file with
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start renew-letsencrypt.timer
systemctl enable renew-letsencrypt.timer
```

Check the timers status:
```
systemctl list-timers renew-letsencrypt.timer
```


## If you have another webserver in front

*(It may happen even in the best families)*

Say you have apache in front of zimbra (or listening on port 80 only) just run `certbot-auto` to request the certificate for apache, and when done run
```
/usr/local/bin/certbot_zimbra.sh --renew --no-nginx
```
so that it will deploy the certificate in zimbra without patching nginx.

## Creating a patch

Since v0.2 patches are embedded into the script. To produce a patch:

1. make a fresh zimbra installation
1. make a copy of the vanilla `/opt/zimbra/conf/nginx/templates` location (i.e. `cp -r /opt/zimbra/conf/nginx/templates /opt/zimbra/conf/nginx/templates_ORIG`)
1. patch the templates file by adding the `.well-known/acme-challenge` location with a webroot (see existing patches)
1. produce a patchfile, making sure to have only one directory below: `cd /opt/zimbra/conf/nginx/ ; diff -Naur templates_ORIG templates > /tmp/zimbra_YOURVERSION.patch`
1. embed the patch in the *patches* section
1. add the version condition in `patch_nginx` function

## Upgrade from v0.1

If you originally requested the certificate with the first version of the script, which used *standalone* method, newer version will fail to renew. This because it
now uses *webroot* mode by patching Zimbra's nginx, making it more simple to work and to mantain.

To check if you have the old method, run `grep authenticator /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/YOURDOMAIN.conf`. If it says *standalone* you got it!

To get it back working, @andrewmur on [issue #43](https://github.com/YetOpen/certbot-zimbra/issues/43#issuecomment-400018603) suggests to stop (and kill, to make sure) nginx
before renewal. This is proven to work (by  him).

A more *definitive* solution would be to try forcing the issue of a new certificate in *webroot* mode, so that it will work with newver versions of the scripts. But this is
untested. ;)
